Java-front for Stratego/XT 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

2009-07-09 - Java-front 0.9

  This is a minor update of Java-front, a package that provides
  the syntax-related support for implementing Java transformation
  systems. 

  * Wrapper strategies for Java to Java transformation tools

  Added the long requested wrapper strategies for creating Java to Java
  transformation tools.

    io-java2java-wrap(s) =
    io-java2java-wrap(extra-opts, s) =
    io-java2java-wrap(extra-opts, usage, about, s) =

  Creating a source to source tool is now as easy as:

  ------------------------------
    module foo
    imports libstratego-lib libjava-front
    strategies

    main =
      io-java2java-wrap(foo)
 
    foo =
    // some AST transformation
  ------------------------------

  $ strc -i foo.str $(strcflags stratego-lib java-front)
  $ ./foo -i Foo.java -o Bar.java
 

  * Pretty printer available as library
  
  The java-front pretty-printer can now be used as a
  separately compiled library.

  * Java embedding

  Renovation of the Java embedding definitions. The preferred embedding is now
  no longer using a prefixed version of Java, but a mix version of Java.

  The preferred definition for embedding Java is now
  EmbeddedJavaMix.def. This module is parameterized with two symbols:

    1) The context of Java.
    2) The expression non-terminal of the host language.

  If you use StrategoRenamed, then the import can be something like
  this:

  languages/java/EmbeddedJavaMix[Java StrategoTerm]

  The advantage of having EmbeddedJavaMix is that you can easily embed
  multiple languages, even if more than one of these languages involve
  Java. Suppose that you have a language Foo that extends Java:

  -------------------------------------
  module Foo
  imports
  languages/java/JavaMix[Foo] 
  
  exports
  ...
  -------------------------------------
 
  and Foo is embedded in Stratego:

  -------------------------------------
  module StrategoFoo
  imports
  languages/stratego/StrategoMix[Stratego]
  Foo

  exports
  ...
  -------------------------------------

  In this situation the composer of the embeddings can decide if he (she
  is unlikely) wants to support the variables and anti-quotations in Foo
  quotations and if Foo constructs should be supported in Java
  quotations.
  
  If this should be allowed, then EmbeddedJavaMix can be imported with
  the parameters [Foo Term[[Stratego]]]. If this should not be allowed,
  then a different first parameter can be chosen.


  * AST changes
  
  There have been some minor changes is the syntax definition that change
  the Java AST to previous versions, and therefore might break existing 
  code. 
  
  ** Replaced ClassName with TypeName. This changes the representation of:
     - Qualified super field access
     - Qualified super method invocation
     - Qualified this.
     All these constructs are now qualified by a TypeName instead of a
     ClassName.
  ** Change in modifiers: Anno is no longer a Mod
  ** GenericStaticMethod has been renamed to GenericMethod and the prefix
     of the GenericMethod is now an AmbName, not a TypeName. This
     represents the syntactical ambiguity better.

2005-11-04 - Java-front 0.8

  This is another major update of Java-front, a package that provides
  the syntax-related support for implementing Java transformation
  systems.

  * Syntax Definition

  By default, parse-java now uses a syntax definition that has only a
  single start symbol (CompilationUnit). This is a major improvement
  of the performance and error reporting of the SGLR used in
  parse-java. If you specify a custom start symbol, then a syntax
  definition with more start symbols will be used.

  Minor change in the definition of type parameters to make the
  structure of formal type parameters more close to the structure of
  ordinary type parameters. Example: the new representation is
  TypeParam(Id("T"), None). Was: TypeParam(TypeVar(Id("T")), None).

  Added ClassDecStm constructor for type declarations at statement
  level.

  * Pretty Printer

  Generic constructors couldn't be pretty-printed in the previous
  release of Java-front. This has now been fixed.

  * Compilation

  Java-front now declares an xtc_repos variable. In Java-front
  dependent packages you can simply refer to JAVA_FRONT_XTC instead of
  hard-coding the path to the XTC repository.

  Java-front now declares the strcflags and strcxtcflags variable. At
  the command-line you can now compile a java-front program with:

  $ strc -i foo.str $(strcflags java-front) 

  and optionally: $(strcxtcflags java-front) if you want to use the
  XTC repository of Java-front. These strcflags commands will
  automatically add the appropriate include and XTC repository
  arguments, so that you don't have to remember all these details.

  You need the following bash shell aliases for this:

  alias strcflags="pkg-config --variable=strcflags "
  alias strcxtcflags="pkg-config --variable=strcxtcflags "

2005-05-24 - Java-front 0.7

  This is a major update of Java-front, a package that provides the
  syntax-related support for implementing Java transformation
  systems.

  * Syntax Definition

  Types that refer to member types of a parameterized class (e.g. the
  type =M<O>.N=) are now supported. The change does not affect the AST
  of members of unparameterized classes. The issue was reported by
  Valentin David. Thanks!

  This release adds support for hexadecimal floating-point literals,
  which is a feature that was added to JLS3 without much
  fanfare. Hexadecimal floating-point literals have been added to Java
  to allow "precise and predictable specification of particular
  floating-point values".
  
  The parse table =Java-15.tbl= now contains only a single start
  symbol: =CompilationUnit=. This results in better error reporting,
  for obscure reasons. The tool =parse-java= uses a different
  parse table with more start-symbols if a different (i.e. not
  =CompilationUnit=) start symbol is specified, otherwise
  =Java-15.tbl= is used.

  The constructor of the =assert= statement is now =AssertStm= (was
  =Assert=). This was requested by Valentin David to avoid name
  clashes.

  Java-front 0.7 does no longer contain the obsolete 'basic' and
  'generic' variants of the Java syntax definition. These variants
  have been deprecated for quite some time and do not seem to be in
  use anymore.

  * Pretty Printer

  The Java-front syntax and pretty-printer is now tested with the most
  recent version of GNU Classpath: 0.15. This release contains much
  more Java code, which makes the testing even more thorough.

  A minor bug in the pretty-printing of qualified types has been
  fixed. This issue only showed up when pretty-printing an AST after a
  transformation that produces empty type qualifiers. This is pattern
  that will never be produced by the parser. The pretty-printer now
  supports these empty qualifiers.

  Internally, the pretty-printer has been restructured to be more
  modular. The module structure is similar to the syntax
  definition of Java. The pretty-printer is now available as a
  Stratego library as well (=java/pp/-= in the share directory).

  * Stratego Library

  This release of Java-front generates a module of typematching
  strategies (e.g =is-Expr=) and installs it for use in your Stratego
  programs: =java/typematch/common= (contributed by Rob Vermaas).

  * Embedding of Java in Stratego

  A bug in the meta variable for lists of formal parameters has been
  fixed (reported by Pankaj Risbood, fixed by Rob Vermaas). Also,
  several ambiguity problems have been fixed, some related to
  undesired splitting of identifiers (fixed by Rene de Groot).

  The embedding now supports more verbose meta variables, which
  include a custom name, instead of just allowing a number. Example:
  =bstm_foo= (contributed by Rene de Groot).

  * Deployment

  Java-front now uses (and requires) pkg-config. This means that
  explicit configuration with the location of aterm, sdf, and
  strategoxt is no longer required. A plain =./configure= should do
  the job. However, you might need to set your =PKG_CONFIG_PATH= if
  you did not install the dependencies in a standard
  location. Configure will tell you to do this if it cannot find
  aterm, sdf or strategoxt.

  =pkg-config= can also be used to compile your Stratego program in a
  more convenient way from the command-line. Java-front declares a
  pkg-config variable =strcflags=, which contains the required include
  flags. For an example on how to use this =strcflags= variable, see:
  
  http://www.stratego-language.org/Stratego/PkgConfig

  * Documentation

  A code browser for the syntax definition of Java is now available
  from the Java-front website. This feature has been contributed by
  Rob Vermaas, the author of xdoc, wich is used to generate the code
  browser.

2005-01-14 - Java-front 0.6

  This a minor update of Java-front. In this release, the embedding of
  Java in Stratego has been improved and generalized, to make it
  reusable for embedding in other programming languages.

  Java syntax definition

   * Generalized parameterized types to allow any type as actual type
     argument. The actual limitation to reference type of the current
     Java version should be enforced by semantic checks, since it is a
     semantic limitation.

   * Introduced a general sort (=Modifier=) for all modifiers.

  Java embedding in Stratego

   * =e= is now a meta variable for the left-hand side of an
     assignment.

   * Added quotations for variables, quotations, names, and modifiers.

   * Added disambiguations to support disabling of heuristic filters in
     SGLR. These can be disabled by specifying =HeuristicFilters(Off)=
     in the =.meta= file. See the new of StrategoXT 0.13 for more
     information.

   * Removed the quotation with explicit disambiguation for a list of
     block statement. This is always ambiguous with a single block
     statement, which only shows up if you disable the heuristic
     filters of sglr.

2004-10-04 - Java-front 0.5 

  We are pleased to announce the first official release of java-front.

  Java-front is a package that adds support for Java meta-programming to
  StrategoXT. It contains a handcrafted SDF grammar for Java as it
  appears in J2SE 5.0, Stratego signatures generated from this grammar,
  and a handcrafted pretty printer that supports comment preserving
  transformations.

  The Java syntax definition and pretty-printer are very well
  tested. Java-front is able to parse and pretty-print (round trip is
  checked) all the Java sources in the GNU Classpath and Sun's JDK
  runtime libraries.

2002-11-13

  The Stratego-Box grammar has been removed from Java Front. It is
  temporary available as a separate package stratego-box until it will
  be available as a part of GPP.

2002-08-21

  Java Front now comes with a grammar for Generic-Java.  Although
  Generic-Java is a language shared by many proposals for parameterized
  types, this grammar is designed to be compatible with JSR-14: "Adding
  Generics to the Java Programming Language". Of course there is also a
  Stratego-Generic-Java grammar. The pretty-printer has been extended to
  handle generics.

2002-08-20

  The grammar for mixing Stratego and Java has been improved after some
  code generation experiments. Future versions of Java Front might
  include some strategies for code-generation in Stratego.

2002-08-19

  Java Front now comes with a hand-crafted pretty printer This
  pretty-printer has been written in Stratego with concrete syntax for
  the box language of Merijn de Jonge.
